Pokedecs 

Scroll through our pokemon directory and build your team. 

API: 

The users have the ability to scroll through a list of pokemon characters.
Once the user clicks on a specific dec card the characters image and their character information will be displayed.
Users can build their personal pokemon deck team by adding the character to their team inventory(team limit is set to 6).
Users can delete a pokemon character from their team as well as search up specific pokemon characters. Users will be 
able to see a image preview of their team in their inventory, click on them to pull up their information, as well as toggle
